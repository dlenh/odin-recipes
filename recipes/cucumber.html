    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Spicy cucumber salad, also known as <em>oi muchim</em>, is a popular side dish in Korean culture. 
    Fresh cucumbers are marinated in a mixture of vinegar, red pepper flakes, soy sauce, sugar, along with other ingredients. 
    They retain their crunchiness, make for a refreshing appetizer, and pair well with rice or noodles.</p>

    <p>All of the ingredients can be found at your local Korean market. If you cannot find Korean cucumbers, 
    a variety of different cucumbers, like English, Japanese, or Persian, works for this recipe as well. 
    <em>Gochugaru</em>, coarsely ground Korean red chili pepper flakes, usually comes in big bags, but it can be used in other delicious recipes.</p>

    <p>The secret to retaining the cucumbers' crunchiness is by using salt to draw out their natural moisture content. The other ingredients 
    then create a flavor profile that is spicy, tangy, and a bit sweet to complement the crunch.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Korean cucumber</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon <em>gochugaru</em> (Korean red pepper flakes)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons rice wine vinegar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>1 green onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons sesame oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons sesame seeds, toasted</li> 
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice the cucumber to desired thickness (1/4 to 1/2-inch thick). Toss gently with salt and rice wine vinegar and set aside for 15-30 minutes. This pickling method will draw out the cucumbers' moisture content.</li>
        <li>Rinse the cucumbers under running water and try a piece. Continue rinsing until desired level of saltiness. Remember that soy sauce, another source of sodium, will be added later.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, mix together <em>gochugaru</em>, sugar, soy sauce, minced garlic, chopped green onions, sesame oil, and toasted sesame seeds.</li>
        <li>Toss cucumbers with dressing until well-coated.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
